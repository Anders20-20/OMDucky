REM | Win-SSH_DC_Tunnel.ducky.txt
REM |
REM | This is a script for the Rubber Ducky.
REM | It will identity an active Domain Controller, then build an SSH reverse tunnel to the attacker, 
REM | and giving the attacker network access to the Domain Controller.
REM |
REM | For setup, your attacker machine needs public IP ssh access with a user/password created for this purpose.
REM | Once script is successful, you can access common DC ports on this machine, such as "curl localhost:10080"
REM | (Common DC ports will have 10000 added to them, so SMB/445 will be at localhost:10445, etc)
REM |
REM | This script uses the built in SSH function that is installed by default on newer Win10 deployments.
REM | Does not require admin access on victim, and generally will be allowed by Windows Defender or other antiviruses.
REM | (However, this does not gain any shell access to victim machine)
REM | Script also hides the powershell console, and SSH runs in the background indefinitely.
REM |
REM | See all "REM ~~" tilde lines below for code that needs to be modified!
