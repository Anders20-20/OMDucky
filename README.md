OMDucky
=============
Hello! This is a collection of scripts for O.MG Cable and Rubber Ducky. Since they use similar syntax, and all...More info coming soon!


Notable Differences
===========
- O.MG delay are in seconds, Ducky delays are in milliseconds. That means in O.MG, use "DELAY 1" versus "DELAY 1000"
- O.MG currently has issues interpreting ALT and CTRL (Seems to interfere with GUI). Leave them out if possible.
- O.MG currently has a total string output character limit around 155 characters.
- Particuarly in Ducky, combined characters should be lowercased if normal characters. E.G. use "GUI r" and NOT "GUI R"
